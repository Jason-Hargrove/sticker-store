# Radioactive Sticker Store
This app lets users add stickers to a gallery page, click on an individual sticker to update, delete, or buy. The buy button decreases the quantity of that type of sticker till they are sold out.

# Project Improvements
The gallery ```/stickers/``` should center at desktop width. The buy and update page should center items as well. ```a.nav_gallery```, on the buy page should have bottom margin. Index page needs a welcome link, or something more inviting.

I’m a Software Engineer with a background in fine art. I tackle hidden problems by throwing myself into my work, finding connections between unrelated things, and turning my thoughts into something real. I believe the fear of the unknown can be overcome with a well designed product, and I’m passionate about presenting it in a unique way. My background in graphic design and my experience as a street artist enables me to approach each project with a spirit for communicating graphically to provoke a reaction.
