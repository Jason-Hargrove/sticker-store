# Radioactive Sticker Store
This app lets users add stickers to a gallery page, click on an individual sticker to update, delete, or buy. The buy button decreases the quantity of that type of sticker till they are sold out.

# Project Improvements
The gallery ```/stickers/``` should center at desktop width. The buy and update page should center items as well. ```a.nav_gallery```, on the buy page should have bottom margin. Index page needs a welcome link, or something more inviting.
